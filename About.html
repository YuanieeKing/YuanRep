        <h2>Volleyball</h2>
        <p>One of my hobbies is volleyball. I’m not a professional player, I just like to play, joining in school competitions like intramurals or just a fun game with friends. I like playing the position of libero because I love that feeling when you receive the ball from an attack or serve.</p>

    <!-- Dance Section -->
    <div class="content-container">
        <img src="img/dance.jpg" alt="Dancing">
        <h2>Dancing</h2>
        <p>Dancing is a passion of mine. I would like to be a professional dancer someday, but right now I’m just an amateur. I started dancing when I was still in elementary, dancing for school projects, intermission numbers, or just for fun. I’m not part of any group, I’m too shy for that. I danced in school competitions only, currently I’m one of the members for the COT street dance for intramurals.</p>

    <!-- Chess Section -->
    <div class="content-container">
        <img src="img/ch.jpg" alt="Chess">
        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <p>I’ve only recently started playing chess. I played during 11th grade because one of my new friends was playing it professionally. I got hooked, I love the strategy, the planning, the mind games you could do. Chess is fun, especially when you’re winning.</p>
